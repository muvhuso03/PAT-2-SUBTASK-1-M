Morse Code Overview
What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a method of transmitting text using a series of dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. It can be used with sound, light, or written symbols.

Who Created Morse Code?
Morse code was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse, an American inventor, and Alfred Vail, his colleague. While Morse conceptualized the system for use with the electric telegraph, Vail helped refine it into a practical code using dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers.

Why Was Morse Code Created?
Morse code was created to allow fast, long-distance communication using electric telegraph systems. Before its invention, messages had to be physically delivered, which was slow. The system of dots and dashes made it possible to send and receive complex messages quickly through simple electrical signals.

How Was Morse Code Created?
Morse code was created by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail as a way to encode letters and numbers using a series of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). Each character was assigned a unique combination that could be sent as electrical pulses over a telegraph wire. The simplicity of the code made it easy to learn and transmit by sound, light, or writing.

Historical Context:
Morse code was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. It was originally created for use with the electric telegraph system. The system allowed messages to be sent over long distances in a time when no faster method existed.

How does a Morse Code work?
Each character (letter or number) in Morse code is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes:

A dot is a short signal (often a quick sound or flash)
A dash is a longer signal
For example:

A = . -
B = - . . .
C = - . - .
D = -..
E = .
F = ..-.
G = --.
H = ....
I = ..
J = .---
K = -.-
L = .-..
M = --
N = -.
O = ---
P = .--.
Q = --.-
R = .-.
S = ...
T = -
U = ..-
V = ...-
W = .--
X = -..-
Y = -.--
Z = --..
Letters are separated by spaces, and words are separated by slashes (/) or longer pauses.

I = ..

A = .-
M = --

K = -.-
E = .
D = -..
I = ..
B = -...
O = ---
N = -.
E = .
